# UlsterBankHackathon
Ulster Bank together with the Open Bank Project invites you to the 8th edition of Hack (Make!) The Bank which will be held from January 30th to February 1st at NDRC in Dublin.

Hack (Make!) the Bank is a global series of Fin Tech Hackathons which are dedicated to realising tomorrow's banking and financial solutions. This hackathon will bring together programmers, designers and members of the financial services industry to debate, design, code and pitch ideas on themes related to the challenges set below.

Developers won’t have access to real customer data but will instead use the Open Bank Project API ‘sandbox’ to simulate access to customer data and banking services as well as other API’s and data sets.


The Open Bank Project is an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services.
